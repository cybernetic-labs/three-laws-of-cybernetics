**Introduction:**
The "Three Laws of Cybernetics" have been formulated to guide responsible development and prioritize user safety.

### I. Conditions for Physical Interaction:
#### I-i: Safe Operation Without Extensive Training
A robot should be designed to operate safely even with minimal user training, ensuring that physical interaction poses no harm.

#### I-ii: Regulated Mechanical and Electronic Components
Stringent regulations guarantee the safety of physical interactions by ensuring the reliability and safety of mechanical and electronic components.

### II. Responsibility for Harm:
Developers bear ethical responsibility for any potential physical and emotional harm caused by their robotic creations. This underscores the importance of thorough risk assessment and ethical considerations in the development process.

### III. Abortion Plan (Emergency Shutdown):
To address unforeseen risks, users are equipped with an "Abortion Plan" or emergency shutdown mechanism. This empowers users to swiftly halt a robot's operations in situations demanding an immediate cessation of activity.

### Calling for Contributions:
We invite the global community to contribute to the evolution of the "3 Laws of Cybernetics." Your insights, experiences, and diverse perspectives are invaluable in refining and expanding this ethical framework. Join us in shaping the future of intelligent machines by participating in the discussion and contributing to the ongoing dialogue on responsible robotics development.

Embrace the "3 Laws of Cybernetics" as foundational principles, guiding the development and deployment of intelligent machines with a focus on ethical considerations, user safety, and developer accountability.
